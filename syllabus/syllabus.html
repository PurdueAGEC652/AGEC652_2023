<h2 id="course-description">Course description</h2>
<p>This course will introduce you to key computational methods used in applied economics research and prepare you to use these methods in your own projects. The overall objective of this course is to expand your skills for applied research by adding numerical methods to your toolset: you will understand why and when computational methods are needed in economics research, learn to identify and model economic problems that can be solved with such methods, and apply the appropriate method for each type of problem.</p>
<p>This course can be conceptually divided into three parts. In the first part, we will cover the fundamentals of scientific computing and best practices for research. In the second part, we will study and apply core computational methods, including numerical calculus and linear algebra, systems of equations, and constrained and unconstrained optimization. In the third and final part, we will see how to take to data the models we learned to solve and introduce structural estimation of static models.</p>
<h2 id="learning-outcomes">Learning outcomes</h2>
<p>By the end of this course, you should be able to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set up and manage a small scientific computing project</li>
<li>Program computational routines in Julia to solve numerical problems</li>
<li>Calculate numerical derivatives and integrals</li>
<li>Find numerical solutions for linear and nonlinear systems of equations</li>
<li>Calculate numerical function approximations</li>
<li>Find numerical solutions for constrained and unconstrained optimization problems</li>
<li>Program estimators for structural economic modeling</li>
</ol>
<p>These learning outcomes correspond to twenty specific learning standards, which are listed <a href="#learning-standards">at the bottom of this syllabus</a>.</p>
<h2 id="learning-resources-and-technology">Learning resources and technology</h2>
<p><strong>Readings</strong></p>
<p>This course will be based on lecture notes/slides and select research papers. Course materials and references to research papers will be posted on the course website.</p>
<p>The second part of the course will be closely related to select chapters from the textbooks listed below. While there is no official textbook for this course, I recommend that you consult these references for a deeper understanding of the methods we review in class with limited time.</p>
<ul>
<li>[MF02] Miranda, Mario J. and Paul L. Fackler. <em>Applied Computational Economics and Finance</em>. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2002.</li>
<li>[J98] Judd, Kenneth L. <em>Numerical Methods in Economics</em>. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1998.</li>
<li>[NW06] Nocedal, J. and S. J. Wright. <em>Numerical Optimization</em>. New York: Springer, 2nd edition, 2006.</li>
</ul>
<p>Purdue Library offers online access to [MF02] and [NW06] and physical copies of [J98].</p>
<p><strong>Software</strong></p>
<p>Coding examples in this course will use <a href="https://julialang.org">Julia language</a>. Julia is a modern open-source programming language with excellent performance for numerical methods. It has an intuitive syntax and offers many packages to automate the methods we will learn and practice in this course. During the first part of the course, we will go over how to set up your coding environment for Julia.</p>
<p>Two good introductions to Julia are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning Julia <a href="https://julialang.org/learning">(https://julialang.org/learning)</a></li>
<li>QuantEcon Julia lectures 1 to 5 <a href="https://julia.quantecon.org/intro.html">(https://julia.quantecon.org/intro.html)</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Hardware</strong></p>
<p>This course is designed to offer several opportunities for your to code and experiment with the methods we study. For this reason, you will need to bring a laptop to class. Please let me know if you do not have access to a laptop for that purpose.</p>
<p><em>A note on class conduct and etiquette</em>: You are encouraged to bring a laptop to class. However, please limit your use of the laptop to either working on programming examples or taking notes. Please refrain from using other mobile devices – phones or tablets – as they are distracting to you and others around you (if you have an emergency or other reason that requires you to monitor these devices, please let me know in advance). If a student’s use of an electronic device is disruptive to teaching and/or learning, I will ask that the student to discontinue the use of that device. Please be considerate of those around you.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="assignments-and-grading">Assignments and grading</h2>
<p><em>(The assessment structure in this course is quite different from the traditional way in graduate courses. Please read this section closely.)</em></p>
<p>To effectively learn computational methods, one must learn how to program and use them. In this course, all activities and assignments are designed to guide you through the process of learning the course concepts and how to put them into practice. Some of your work will be collected and graded, and it will directly contribute to your course grade.</p>
<p>This course follows a methodology called Standards-Based Grading. There is a list of 20 learning standards for this course <a href="#learning-standards">at the bottom of this syllabus</a>, 8 of which are indicated as core standards. Instead of receiving a numerical score, you will instead be graded as either Mastered or Not Yet Mastered on each standard that is on that assessment. Standards will be assessed multiple times throughout the semester. Unlike most classes, these numbers will not be averaged. Instead, your grade will be computed in a way that rewards growth and continued mastery of the material. <strong>Each standard will be scored as Not Yet Mastered (NY), Mastered (MS), or Continued Mastery (CM)</strong>. These are defined as having demonstrated mastery on 0, 1, or 2+ assessments, respectively.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-assessments">Types of assessments</h3>
<p>There will be three types of assessments: weekly problems, mini-project, and in-class practice.</p>
<p><strong>1. Weekly problems</strong></p>
<p>In most weeks, you will be assigned a problem that relates to recent topics we covered in class. These problems will typically be released on Fridays, and you will have one week to submit your solution.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Submissions are individual</strong>. You are encouraged to discuss the problem with your classmates (and with me), but the code you submit must represent your attempt to solve the problem.</li>
<li><strong>Weekly problems are assessed based on the <a href="#learning-standards">learning standards</a> clearly indicated in each problem and will be graded as Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory.</strong> Each submission will be graded Satisfactory if it meets the following two criteria:
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The assignment is submitted before the deadline. Submissions past the deadline will be automatically marked Unsatisfactory.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>The assignment shows a good-faith effort to solve the proposed problems. This is similar to the criterion used for weekly problems. Submissions that do not attempt to solve a substantial part of the problem or have answers where a good-faith effort is not evident - for example, if the response is &quot;I don't know&quot; or &quot;I don't understand&quot; - will be automatically marked Unsatisfactory.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If your submission is <em>Satisfactory</em>, the feedback you receive will indicate whether you demonstrated mastery for each standard. If your submission is <em>Unsatisfactory</em>, it will not be used to assess any learning standards.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Mini-project</strong></p>
<p>During the second half of this course, you will develop, present, and submit a mini-project. This mini-project consists of a narrow but well-defined economic question that you will formulate as a computational problem and solve. Later in the course, I will give you a list of suggested questions for your mini-project, but you are free to propose your own.</p>
<p>You will submit a <strong>one-page proposal</strong> for the mini-project around week 9 (the exact date will be announced in advance). <em>This proposal will not be graded.</em> It will serve for me to give you feedback and suggest any adjustments to make sure your project is feasible and in line with the assignment expectations (most frequently, students shoot for projects that require much more effort than necessary).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Submissions are individual</strong>. You are encouraged to discuss your project with classmates (and with me), but your mini-project question must be unique (i.e., it cannot be the same question as someone else in the course) and the materials you submit must reflect your individual work.</li>
<li>A complete submission of the mini-project has three components:
<ol>
<li>A 10-minute presentation to the class during Week 16.</li>
<li>A code package that is reproducible (I can easily run it and check your results) and documented (I can find instructions on how to run it).</li>
<li>A report that briefly defines the question, the computational approach, and the results. This report should have an 11-point font, 1.5 line spacing, 1-inch margins, and a maximum length of 3 pages (excluding tables, graphs, and references).
-There are two parts to the grading of mini-projects:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>It will be used as an additional assessment of the Scientific Programming <a href="#learning-standards">learning standards</a> <strong>plus up to 5 other standards you can choose</strong> to be evaluated on. After you submit your proposal, we will have an individual feedback meeting where we will discuss your choice of standards. You may ask to change these standards as you make progress in the project, and I will consider these changes individually.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol start="2">
<li>The overall mini-project submission will be graded using the EMRN rubric, a four-level rubric that marks the work with grades of E (Excellent/Exemplary), M (Meets expectations), R (needs Revision), or N (Not assessable). See the diagram below summarizing how this rubric works. I will give you feedback on your presentation and indicate whether you are on track to achieve your intended grade in the mini-project.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. In-class practice</strong></p>
<p>In-class practice comes in two flavors:</p>
<ul>
<li>A) <strong>Quick problems</strong> will happen during short lecture breaks (5 to 10 minutes) to give you a chance to approach a new problem and try to structure a solution. In most cases, this short break will not be enough for you to program a complete solution. Don’t despair: that is intentional! The goal is for you to better understand a problem by attempting to solve it before you see a &quot;textbook solution.&quot;</li>
<li>B) <strong>Labs</strong> will happen in class during a longer session (30+ minutes) where you will attempt to solve a more elaborate problem by following step-by-step instructions. Typically, you will be asked to solve a sequence of smaller problems that will lead you to a complete solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following rules apply to quick problems and labs:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Submissions are individual</em>. You are encouraged to discuss the problem with your classmates, but you must type and submit your own solution code. You will receive instructions on how to submit in-class activities in the first part of the course.</li>
<li><em>In-class practice submissions are graded as Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory.</em> Each submission will be graded Satisfactory if it meets the following two criteria:
<ul>
<li>The assignment is submitted before the deadline: typically, by the end of the class (i.e., 5:45 PM). Submissions past the deadline will be automatically marked Unsatisfactory.</li>
<li>The assignment shows a good-faith effort to solve the proposed problems. This is similar to the criterion used for weekly problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Most importantly, note that correctness is not factored into the grade for in-class practice</strong>, so you should feel free to give your best effort on each one without fear of being counted off for wrong answers. In fact, allowing you to have misconceptions and making code errors with very low stakes is the main goal of these activities, so that you can receive prompt feedback and improve.</p>
<h3 id="tokens">Tokens</h3>
<p>Tokens are a &quot;currency&quot; in this course that you can use to purchase exceptions to the course rules. <strong>Each student begins the course with five tokens</strong>, and tokens can purchase any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A 48-hour extension of the submission deadline of a weekly problem.</li>
<li>A 48-hour extension of the submission deadline of the in-class practice of one lecture.</li>
<li>A reassessment of one learning standard (see details below).</li>
</ul>
<p>Opportunities to earn more tokens may be made available during the semester.</p>
<h3 id="reassessment">Reassessment</h3>
<p>One key aspect of this system is constant reassessment. A standard can be reassessed explicitly on another weekly problem, even if the main topic has changed (for example, a problem assessing optimization could also assess your mastery of numerical differentiation). Additionally, you can request to be reassessed on a standard during my office hours. This reassessment can take several forms, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>I might make up a problem or two and have you solve it.</li>
<li>I might ask you to revise your answer to a problem and explain your rationale.</li>
<li>I might ask you to explain the concept using pen and paper.</li>
</ul>
<p>A few rules apply to office hour reassessments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Office hour reassessments are given at the discretion of the instructor: they are not guaranteed opportunities. Reassessment opportunities may be limited by practical considerations, such as time - particularly towards the end of the semester.</li>
<li>You need to email me requesting a reassessment <em>at least one week in advance</em> of your intended reassessment date and indicate which standard you want to be reassessed.</li>
<li>In order to reassess a standard, you must have earned Satisfactory in at least one weekly problem corresponding to that standard.</li>
<li>You can ask to demonstrate <em>Continued Mastery</em> of a standard. However, to qualify as <em>Continued Mastery</em>, it must be at least a week after you first mastered the standard.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remember: The goal is to view reassessments as opportunities for you to demonstrate your continuous improvement and mastery.</strong></p>
<h3 id="course-grade">Course grade</h3>
<p>Your final grade in the course is determined by the following table. Each grade has a <em>requirement</em> specified in its row in the table. <strong>To earn a grade, you will need to meet ALL the requirements in the row for that grade</strong>. Put differently, your grade is the <strong>highest</strong> grade level for which <strong>all</strong> the requirements in a row of the table have been met or exceeded.</p>

<p>A grade of F is given if none of the rows has been fully completed.</p>
<p><strong>Plus/minus grades</strong>: Plus/minus grades will be assigned at my discretion based on how close you are to the next higher or lower grade level.</p>
<p>The minimum requirements for grade determination might be lowered at the time of final grade assignment at the instructor’s discretion (e.g., the required number of mastered standards to earn B might be decreased). Any adjustment in the grade scale will be applied uniformly to all students.</p>
<h2 id="academic-integrity">Academic integrity</h2>
<p>The work you submit in this course must reflect exclusively your effort and must not come significantly from the work of others. I encourage you to study and discuss the course materials and assignments with your peers. However, you are responsible for making sure that you follow the rules laid out in this syllabus and in Purdue University's Academic Integrity definitions <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/odos/osrr/academic-integrity/index.html">(https://www.purdue.edu/odos/osrr/academic-integrity/index.html)</a>.</p>
<p>If for any reason you find yourself under excessive pressure or stress and feel tempted to break our Academic Integrity rules, <strong>PLEASE STOP AND GET HELP</strong> from me, the instructor. I am available and willing to work with you to help you succeed in this course through your legitimate hard work.</p>
<p>In addition to Purdue's Academic Integrity rules, in this course we will adopt the following specific policies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Weekly problems</strong>: you are encouraged to discuss the problem with your classmates (and with me), but the code you submit must represent your attempt to solve the problem.</li>
<li><strong>Mini-project</strong>: you are encouraged to discuss your project with classmates (and with me), but the materials you submit must reflect your individual work.</li>
<li><strong>In-class practice:</strong> you are encouraged to discuss the problem with your classmates, but you must type and submit your own solution code.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Any evidence of plagiarism will be investigated as a violation of academic integrity.</strong> The instructor reserves the right to use any tools available for detecting plagiarism in code and text submitted in the assignments. These include, but are not limited to, <a href="https://www.turnitin.com/">Turnitin</a> and software with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_similarity_detection#In_source_code">specialized algorithms for detecting code similarity</a>. Comparisons might be made between submissions of enrolled students, and a bank of solutions from past offerings, and code available on the Internet.</p>
<p>Academic integrity is one of the highest values that Purdue University holds. Incidents of academic misconduct in this course will be addressed by the course instructor and referred to the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities (OSRR) for review at the university level. Any violation of course policies as it relates to academic integrity will result minimally in a failing or zero grade for that particular assignment, and at the instructor’s discretion, may result in a failing grade for the course. In addition, all incidents of academic misconduct will be forwarded to OSRR, where university penalties, including removal from the university, may be considered. More details are available on our course Brightspace under University Policies and Statements.</p>
<h2 id="attendance-policy">Attendance policy</h2>
<p>This course follows Purdue’s academic regulations regarding attendance, which states that students are expected to be present for every meeting of the classes in which they are enrolled. Attendance will not be taken directly, but your engagement will be assessed through your participation during in-class activities and office hours and on-time assignment submissions. If you must miss a class at any point in time during the semester - be it for reasons excused by the University (see the <a href="https://catalog.purdue.edu/content.php?catoid=15&amp;navoid=18634#classes">Academic Regulations and Student Conduct section</a> or otherwise - please reach out to me as soon as possible via Purdue email so that we can communicate about how you can maintain your academic progress. I will analyze and make accommodations on a case-by-case basis. If you find yourself too sick to progress in the course, notify your adviser (or program coordinator) and notify me via Purdue email; we will work together to make arrangements based on your particular situation. If you are unable to make direct contact with me and are unable to leave word with the department because of circumstances beyond your control, you or your representative should contact or go to the <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/advocacy/students/absences.html">Office of the Dean of Students website</a> to complete appropriate forms for instructor notification.</p>
<h2 id="course-evaluation">Course evaluation</h2>
<p>During the semester, I will ask for your informal feedback on the course. Participation is anonymous and voluntary. This early feedback will be highly appreciated. It is also an opportunity for your perceptions and concerns to be expressed and for me to make any appropriate adjustments to the course structure before the end of the semester.</p>
<p>Toward the end of this semester, you will be provided with an opportunity to give formal feedback on this course and your instructor. Purdue uses an online course evaluation system. You will receive an official email from evaluation administrators with a link to the online evaluation site and will receive a prompt to complete the survey when you log into Brightspace. Your participation is an integral part of this course, and your feedback is vital to improving education at Purdue University. I strongly urge you to participate in the evaluation system.</p>
