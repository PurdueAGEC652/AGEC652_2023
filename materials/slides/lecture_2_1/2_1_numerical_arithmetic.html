# Briefest review of Computer Systems

### (or How do computers work?)

---

## Why bother?

Knowing the basics of how computers perform the instructions we give them is essential to
- Understand why we write code in certain ways
- Why your program fails or takes forever to run
- Write more efficient routines
- .red[Understand the limits of computational methods in quantitative research]

---

## The building blocks of a computer

&lt;div style="float:right"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/architecture_1.png" height=350&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


**Buses**: where information flows between components. They are design to transport fixed-size chunks known as *words* (32 or 64 bytes in most computers)

--

**I/O devices**: connect the system to the external world
- Input: keyboard, mouse, disks, networks
- Output: display, disks, networks


---

## The building blocks of a computer

&lt;div style="float:right"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/architecture_1.png" height=350&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


**Main memory**: temporary storage of *instructions* (i.e. programs) *and data* 
  - Physically, a collection of DRAM chips
  - Logically, a **linear array of bytes** (8 bits), each with its *unique address*

--

When we allocate a variable of type `Int64`, our program will determine an available address (where that variable starts in memory) and reserve a size (64 bits = 8 bytes, in this case)

--

When we assign `x = 10`, our program writes the binary equivalent of integer `10` in that memory address


---

## The building blocks of a computer


```julia
x = [1 2 3]
```

```
## 1Ã—3 Matrix{Int64}:
##  1  2  3
```

```julia
# This is how we get the physical address (0x means it's in hexadecimal base)
pointer_from_objref(x)
```

```
## Ptr{Nothing} @0x000001c0dbe280b0
```
`\(16\)` digits of hexadecimal number (4 bits): `\(16 \times 4 = 64\)`-bit address

```julia
# Get the size
sizeof(x)
```

```
## 24
```

`\(3 \times\)` `Int64` (8 bytes) `\(= 24\)` bytes

---

## The building blocks of a computer

&lt;div style="float:right"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/architecture_1.png" height=350&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


**CPU**, or processor: it's the computer's engine. It has 3 parts:
  - *Program Counter* (**PC**): keeps the memory address of the current instruction
  - **Registers**: tiny but *ultra-fast memory* (e.g.: 16 64-bit registers on Intel i7)
  - *Arithmetic/logic unit* (**ALU**): performs operations over the values stored in registers 

---

## The building blocks of a computer

CPUs generally operate with a limited number of simple instructions. Any complex calculation translated by the compiler into many simple steps

There are four main types of instructions

- *Load*: copy a value from main memory into a register
- *Store*: copy a value from a register to main memory
- *Operate*: copy 2 values from register to ALU, perform an arithmetic operation on them, store the result in a register
- *Jump*: point the PC to an instruction in another memory address

---

## What happens when we run a program?


```julia
function hello()
  print("hello, world\n")
end;

hello()
```

```
## hello, world
```


---

## What happens when we run a program?

1) Our function `hello` is compiled: another program will read our human language and convert it to *machine language* (instructions)
  - I.e., our code goes from a sequence of bits (`0`s and `1`s) that can be represented as characters in a display to another sequence of bits that represents instructions which the **CPU** can understand

--

2) The compiled function is placed into the **main memory**
  - Compiled code can also be stored in permanent memory (hard drives, SSD, disks). Those are the *executable* files. But before they are executed, they must be loaded into the main memory anyway

---

## What happens when we run a program?

3) We type `hello()` in Julia REPL. Our **input** prompts Julia and the Operating System (OS) to prepare those instructions for execution
  - E.g.: by *jumping* the PC to the address where they are stored

--

4) The **CPU** executes those instructions and **outputs** the results back in the command line, which is then converted into image by a graphics adapter and our display

--

#### Moral of the story: .red[the computer spends A LOT of time just moving information around and very little time actually doing "real work!"]

---

## Running fast

.red[The computer spends A LOT of time just moving information around and very little time actually doing "real work!"] What to do?

--

Efficient computation needs to

1. Minimize the need to pass information around
--
   
   - This is what we do, for example, when we preallocate variables, avoid temporary allocations, vectorize
--

2. Make information travel faster
--
  
  - Faster hardware (not always affordable/available)
  - **Cache memory**!

---

## Cache memory

Physics law: bigger memory = slower memory
- Your hard disk can be `\(1,000\times\)` larger than the main memory but it might take `\(10,000,000\times\)` longer for the processor to read

But the main memory is too big/slow. The CPU actually has its own internal layers of fast memory with different sizes
- Modern processors have registers + 3 levels of cache memory

---

## Cache memory

&lt;div align="center"&gt;
  &lt;img src="figures/memory_hierarchy.png" height=320&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

--

&lt;div style="float:right"&gt;
  .small[*These are Intel specifications* `\(\rightarrow\)`]  &lt;img src="figures/intel_specs.png" height=180&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---

## Writing cache-friendly code

Now that you knowing about the memory hierarchy, you can use that knowledge to write *more efficient, cache-friendly code*. That means:

- Making the common case go fast
  - Programs often spend most of the time in a few loops. **.red[Focus on the inner loops of your core functions]**
--

- Minimize the chances of needing to bring variables from slow memory
  - Reference local variables
  - If you need to reference the same variable in multiple iterations, think about a way order your loops in a way that you make those **.red[repeated references in sequence]**

---

## Operating System

There's an important component between your software and the hardware: the *Operating System* (OS)

--

The OS is a software layer that manages and makes accessible all the hardware components. It transforms those components in simple abstractions that can be easily manipulated with much simpler software instructions

&lt;div align="center"&gt;

# Numerical Arithmetic

---

## Why bother?

Simple arithmetic: `\((10^{-20} + 1) - 1 = 10^{-20} + (1 - 1)\)`, right?

--

Let's check:


```julia
x = (1e-20 + 1) - 1;
y = (1e-20) + (1 - 1);
x == y
```

```
## false
```

- Go ahead, try it! (And submit it later)

#### What happened?!

---

## Why bother?

Welcome to the world of **finite precision**


```julia
x
```

```
## 0.0
```

```julia
y
```

```
## 1.0e-20
```

--

Numbers are an ideal/abstract concept that works perfectly in analytic operations

Computers are a physical machine with limited resources: they can't have infinite precision

--

.red[Understanding this limitation is crucial in numerical analysis]


---

## Number storage

**Q: How are numbers physically represented by a computer?**

--

*A: In a binary (or Base 2) system. This means each digit can only take on 0 or 1*

--

.small[The system we're most used to is Base 10: each digit can take on 0-9]

--

**Q: So which numbers can be represented by a computer?**

--

*A: A* **subset** *of the rational numbers*

--

But computers have .blue[finite] memory and hard disk space, there are .blue[infinite] rational numbers

--

This imposes a strict limitation on the storage of numbers

---

## Number storage

Numbers are stored as: `\(\pm mb^{\pm n}\)`

- `\(m\)` is the *significand*
- `\(b\)` is the *base*,
- `\(n\)` is the *exponent*

All three are integers

--

- The *significand* typically gives the significant digits

- The *exponent* scales the number up or down in magnitude

---

## Number storage

The size of numbers a computer can represent is limited by how much space is allocated for a number

--

Space allocations are usually 64 bits: 53 for `\(m\)` and 11 for `\(n\)`

--

We've seen these types before


```julia
println(typeof(5.0))
```

```
## Float64
```

```julia
println(typeof(5))
```

```
## Int64
```

---

## Number storage

- `Int64` means it is a .blue[integer] with 64 bits of storage

- `Float64` means it is a .blue[floating point number] with 64 bits of storage

  - Floating point just means `\(b^{\pm n}\)` can move the decimal point around in the significand

These two types take the same space in memory (64 bits) but are interpreted differently by the processor 

---

## The limits of computers

Limitations on storage suggest three facts

--

**Fact 1**: There exists a **machine epsilon**: the smallest relative quantity representable by a computer

--

**Machine epsilon** is the smallest `\(\epsilon\)` such that
a machine can always distinguish `$$N+\epsilon &gt; N &gt; N-\epsilon$$`

---

## The limits of computers



```julia
println("Machine epsilon Ïµ is $(eps(Float64))")
```

```
## Machine epsilon Ïµ is 2.220446049250313e-16
```

```julia
println("Is 1 + Ïµ/2 &gt; 1? $(1.0 + eps(Float64)/2 &gt; 1.0)")
```

```
## Is 1 + Ïµ/2 &gt; 1? false
```

The function `eps` gives the distance between 1.0 and the next representable `Float64`

---

## The limits of computers


```julia
println("The smallest representable number larger than 1.0 is $(nextfloat(1.0))")
```

```
## The smallest representable number larger than 1.0 is 1.0000000000000002
```

```julia
println("The largest representable number smaller than 1.0 is $(prevfloat(1.0))")
```

```
## The largest representable number smaller than 1.0 is 0.9999999999999999
```

---

## The limits of computers

The machine epsilon changes depending on the amount of storage allocated

--


```julia
println("32 bit machine epsilon is $(eps(Float32))")
```

```
## 32 bit machine epsilon is 1.1920929e-7
```

```julia
println("Is 1 + Ïµ/2 &gt; 1? $(Float32(1) + eps(Float32)/2 &gt; 1)")
```

```
## Is 1 + Ïµ/2 &gt; 1? false
```

--

**There is a trade-off between precision and storage requirements**  

- This matters for low-memory systems like GPUs

---

## The limits of computers

**Fact 2**: There is a **smallest representable number**


```julia
println("64 bit smallest float is $(floatmin(Float64))")
```

```
## 64 bit smallest float is 2.2250738585072014e-308
```

```julia
println("32 bit smallest float is $(floatmin(Float32))")
```

```
## 32 bit smallest float is 1.1754944e-38
```

```julia
println("16 bit smallest float is $(floatmin(Float16))")
```

```
## 16 bit smallest float is 6.104e-5
```

---

## The limits of computers

**Fact 3**: There is a **largest representable number**


```julia
println("64 bit largest float is $(floatmax(Float64))")
```

```
## 64 bit largest float is 1.7976931348623157e308
```

```julia
println("32 bit largest float is $(floatmax(Float32))")
```

```
## 32 bit largest float is 3.4028235e38
```

```julia
println("16 bit largest float is $(floatmax(Float16))")
```

```
## 16 bit largest float is 6.55e4
```

---

## The limits of computers: time is a flat circle


```julia
println("The largest 64 bit integer is $(typemax(Int64))")
```

```
## The largest 64 bit integer is 9223372036854775807
```

```julia
println("Add one to it and we get: $(typemax(Int64)+1)")
```

```
## Add one to it and we get: -9223372036854775808
```

```julia
println("It loops us around the number line: $(typemin(Int64))")
```

```
## It loops us around the number line: -9223372036854775808
```

---

## The limits of computers

####.red[The scale of your problem matters]####

--

If a parameter or variable is `\(&gt;\)` `floatmax` or `\(&lt;\)` `floatmin`, you will have a very bad time

--

Scale numbers appropriately (e.g. millions of dollars, not millionths of cents)

---

## Error

We can only represent a finite number of numbers

--

This means we will have error in our computations

--

Error comes in two major forms:

1. Rounding
2. Truncation

---

## Rounding

We will always need to round numbers to the nearest computer representable number. This introduces error


```julia
println("Half of Ï€ is: $(Ï€/2)")
```

```
## Half of Ï€ is: 1.5707963267948966
```

--

The computer gave us a rational number, but `\(\pi/2\)` should be irrational

---

## Truncation

Lots of important numbers are defined by infinite sums
`\(e^x = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!}\)`

--

It turns out that computers can't add up infinitely many terms because there is finite space `\(\rightarrow\)` we need to truncate the sum

---

## Why does this matter?

#### Errors are small, who cares? ####

--

.red[You should!]

Because errors can propagate and grow as you keep applying an algorithm (e.g. function iteration)

---

## Error example 1

Let's get back to the example we saw earlier 


```julia
x = (1e-20 + 1) - 1   
```

```
## 0.0
```

```julia
y = 1e-20 + (1 - 1)   
```

```
## 1.0e-20
```

```julia

println("The difference is: $(x-y).")
```

```
## The difference is: -1.0e-20.
```

---

## Error example 1

#### Why did we get `\(y &gt; x\)`? ####

--

- For `\((10^{-20} + 1) - 1\)`: when we added `\(10^{-20}\)` to `\(1\)`, it got rounded away
- For `\(10^{-20} + (1 - 1)\)`: here `\(1-1\)` was evaluated first and return `\(0\)`, as we would expect

--

**Adding numbers of greatly different magnitudes does not always works like you would want**

---


## Error example 2

Consider a simple quadratic eq. `\(x^2-26x+1=0\)` with solution `\(x = 13-\sqrt{168}\)`

--


```julia
println("64 bit: 13 - âˆš168 = $(13-sqrt(168))")
```

```
## 64 bit: 13 - âˆš168 = 0.03851860318427924
```

```julia
println("32 bit: 13 - âˆš168 = $(convert(Float32,13-sqrt(168)))")
```

```
## 32 bit: 13 - âˆš168 = 0.038518604
```

```julia
println("16 bit: 13 - âˆš168 = $(convert(Float16,13-sqrt(168)))")
```

```
## 16 bit: 13 - âˆš168 = 0.0385
```

---

## Error example 2

Let's check whether they solve the equation 

--


```julia
x64 = 13-sqrt(168); x32 = convert(Float32,13-sqrt(168)); x16 = convert(Float16,13-sqrt(168));
f(x) = x^2 - 26x + 1;
println("64 bit: $(f(x64))")
```

```
## 64 bit: 7.66053886991358e-15
```

```julia
println("32 bit: $(f(x32))")
```

```
## 32 bit: 0.0
```

```julia
println("16 bit: $(f(x16))")
```

```
## 16 bit: 0.0004883
```

---

## Error example 3

Let's just subtract two numbers: `100000.2 - 100000.1`

We know the answer is `0.1`

.blue[Try it!]

1. Calculate the difference between `100000.2 - 100000.1`
2. Test (with an `if` clause) if this difference is equal to `0.1`

---

## Error example 3


```julia
println("100000.2 - 100000.1 is: $(100000.2 - 100000.1)")
```

```
## 100000.2 - 100000.1 is: 0.09999999999126885
```

```julia
if (100000.2 - 100000.1) == 0.1
    println("and it is equal to 0.1")
else
    println("and it is not equal to 0.1")
end
```

```
## and it is not equal to 0.1
```

---

## Error example 3

Why do we get this error?

--

Neither of the two numbers can be precisely represented by the machine!

`\(100000.1 \approx 8589935450993459\times 2^{-33} = 100000.0999999999767169356346130\)`
`\(100000.2 \approx 8589936309986918\times 2^{-33} = 100000.1999999999534338712692261\)`

So their difference won't necessarily be 0.1

---

## Error example 3

There are tools for approximate equality. Remember the `$\approx$` operator we saw last lecture? You can use it


```julia
(100000.2 - 100000.1) â‰ˆ 0.1 # You type \approx then hit TAB
```

```
## true
```

This is equivalent to:

```julia
isapprox(100000.2 - 100000.1, 0.1)
```

```
## true
```


#### This matters, particularly when you're trying to evaluate logical expressions of equality
